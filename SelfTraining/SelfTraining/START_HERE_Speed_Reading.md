## The Core Method (3 Passes, 40 Minutes)

### ⏰ Pass 1: SKIM (5 minutes)
- Read: Title, headers, first/last paragraphs, diagrams
- Goal: "What problem? What solution?"
- **Set timer. When it rings → STOP**

### ⏰ Pass 2: FOCUSED READ (20 minutes)  
- Read ONLY: Why, Architecture, Trade-offs, Numbers, Tech choices
- Strategy: First 2-3 sentences of each paragraph
- **Set timer. When it rings → STOP**

### ⏰ Pass 3: SYNTHESIZE (10 minutes)
- Create your interview cheat sheet
- Extract 3-5 key patterns
- Can you explain in 2 minutes? If yes → done!
- **Set timer. When it rings → STOP**

## Your Immediate Action Plan

### Right Now (Next 10 minutes):
1. ✅ Read this file (you're doing it!)
2. ✅ Open the [Quick_Reading_Cheatsheet.txt](Quick_Reading_Cheatsheet.txt)
3. ✅ Print the [Reading_Template.md](Reading_Template.md) if you can

### Today (Next 40 minutes):
1. ✅ Pick ONE article: "How to Design Good APIs" (Tier 1, shortest)
2. ✅ Open [Reading_Template.md](Reading_Template.md) to fill out
3. ✅ Set timer for 5 min → SKIM the article
4. ✅ Set timer for 20 min → READ key sections only
5. ✅ Set timer for 10 min → FILL OUT template
6. ✅ Test: Can you explain in 2 minutes?

### This Week:
- Day 1: API Design (40 min)
- Day 2: Latency vs Throughput (40 min)  
- Day 3: Start Scalability Patterns (40 min, won't finish)
- Day 4: Continue Scalability Patterns (40 min)
- Day 5: Review all 3 topics (30 min)

**Total: ~3.5 hours for 3 articles vs 6+ hours the old way**

## Why This Works

**Your old way:**
- ❌ Reading every word
- ❌ Trying to understand everything
- ❌ No clear goal
- ❌ 2 hours for 300 words

**New way:**
- ✅ Reading for patterns
- ✅ Skipping details
- ✅ Clear extraction goal
- ✅ 40 minutes per article

**The shift:** You're preparing for interviews, not taking a class. You need **talking points**, not **perfect understanding**.

## Common Questions

**Q: "But what if I miss something important?"**
A: If it's important for interviews, it'll be in the key sections (architecture, trade-offs, scale). The details you're missing won't come up.

**Q: "I feel like I'm not learning if I skip so much"**
A: You're learning PATTERNS, which is what matters. Details fade, patterns stick.

**Q: "What if they ask about [specific detail]?"**
A: They won't. Interviewers ask about high-level design, trade-offs, and decisions. Not implementation specifics.

**Q: "Can I really get through an article in 40 minutes?"**
A: Yes! See the example - I did "API Design" in 31 minutes and extracted everything needed for interviews.

**Q: "How do I know if I got enough?"**
A: The 2-minute test: Can you explain the main pattern, trade-offs, and why it matters in 2 minutes? If yes → you're good.

## What to Do When You Get Stuck

**Stuck on understanding something?**
→ Skip it and move on. You don't need perfect understanding.

**Timer rang but you're not done?**
→ STOP ANYWAY. Move to next phase. Trust the process.

**Feel like you're going too fast?**
→ That's the point! Speed is the feature, not a bug.

**Can't explain it in 2 minutes?**
→ You extracted the wrong things. Go back and get the main pattern.

**Want to re-read something?**
→ Don't. Come back in 3 days if really needed.

## Success Criteria

After 2 weeks using this method, you should:

✅ Read 3,000-word article in 40 minutes
✅ Extract 3-5 key patterns per article  
✅ Explain the architecture in 2 minutes
✅ Remember the main points after 1 week
✅ Use the concepts in mock interviews

**If you can't do these → you're still reading too slow!**
